		<h2><b>Classes and Academic</b></h2>
			<p>
				I have taken, and still am taking, a Computer Science class focused around html5, CSS, and JavaScript.  I have taken the initiative to educate myself through other programs. One of the most important resources to me has been <a href="www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>. This website has helped to teach me the basics of all programming languages, and specifically JavaScript and HTML5. In addition to using this resource, I also purchased an AP Computer Science textbook to study from on my own, as my school does not currently offer AP Computer Science.

		<br>
		<h2><b>Extracurricular</b></h2>
		<p>
			Over the past 3 years, I have participated in computer science related FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America) competitions at both the district and state level. The first two years, I participated in the 'Computer Game and Simulation' competition, where I created a short video game from scratch. This year, I created my own website following the theme of a "Family Recreation Center". The source files for all of these projects can be found in the Special Skills tab.
