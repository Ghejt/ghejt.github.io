			<h1>
				<i>Special Skills</i>
			</h1>
			<br>
			<h2><b>Variety of Programming Languages</b></h2>
			<p>
				One skill I pride myself on is my flexibility when it comes to programming languages. I would consider myself at least proficient with JavaScript, Python, HTML5, C++, and Ruby. This skill allows me to not be limited in my job search by what language one company prefers to use.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2><b>Video Game Development</b></h2>
				<p>
					So far I have created two video games from scratch using GameMaker: Studio. This shows that not only can I just type lines of code, I can work with a moving, 3D product.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Download links for my two games projects:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href = "/download/Project1.zip">Project 1</a></li>
					<li><a href = "/download/Tankbuster.zip">Project 2</a></li>
			<h2><b>Web Development</b></h2>
				<p>
					I have successfully created multiple working websites. Most are simply a single page, but I have created at least three full-scale websites. This is particularly useful for a programmer since I would be able to work as an independent contractor if there is ever a time where I struggle to find a normal job.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					All of my web development work can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Ghejt/ghejt.github.io">this</a> github repository.
				</p>
			<h2><b>Ability to Learn Quickly</b></h2>
				<p>
					I have been able to quickly adapt and teach myself new skills over the past few years. When I first participated in the Computer Game and Simulation competition, I had no prior programming knowledge or experience. However, I was able to teach myself through books, websites, and YouTube tutorials within 3 weeks.
				</p>
			<h2><b>Deep Understanding of Programming</b></h2>
				<p>
					After talking to many people in the Programming field, it seems to me that very few truly understand the code that they are working with. After reading chapters upon chapters of my AP Computer Science book, I have been able to understand the inner workings of the programming langauages I use.
