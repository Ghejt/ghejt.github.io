				My name is Nicholas Herbic. I plan to be a software engineer in the future. I am currently a Senior at Arapahoe High School. One extracurricular I participate in is FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America). Competitions in that club are where I have received most of my programming experience. Both Freshman and Sophomore year, I placed in State doing the Computer Game and Simulation competition. Junior year, I participated in the Website Development competition. This year, I am reattempting the Computer Game and Simulation competition while attending an html/css focused Computer Science class to keep my web development skills sharp. The "Special Skills" page will have downloads to all my works, as well as a link to my github page. To help demonstrate my ability to use different programming languages, I have created this entire website from scratch using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
