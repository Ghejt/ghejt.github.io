<h1><strong>Software Engineer</strong></h1>

<h2><b>Description</h2></b>

<p>
As a branch of computer science, software engineering includes the development and building of computer systems software and applications software. Systems software consists of programs that include computing utilities and operations systems and applications software includes user-focused programs, including database programs, Web browsers and more. Knowledge of programming languages, software development and computer operating systems are three major components of the field. Software engineering is a related, but slightly different occupational field than computer hardware engineering, which is concerned with the design and development of hardware and computing technologies (e.g. processor design, networking, etc.)<br><br>Credit to  <a href="www.computerscienceonline.org">Computer Science Online</a> for description</p>

<h2><b>Skills and Education Required</h2></b>

<p>With a sudden boom of popularity in the Computer Science field, it is important for anyone going into the Software Engineer field to know a variety of programming languages, even if they are used for the same thing. Every company is different; some may use Ruby where others use Python, and some may still use C++.<br><br>A good education is also important for people looking to be a Software Engineer. Although some employers will likely hire people with a bachelor's degree so long as they have samples of their work, it is still a good idea to get a Master's in a Computer Science field before diving into the career.</p>


<h2><b>Future Job Outlook</h2></b>

<p>The future of this career looks very bright. From 2012-2022, the field is projected to see a 23% growth in salary (up to $139,900 anually). Although there is a major surge of people going into the field in the next decade or so, it also will have an exponential increase of employers. From 2012-2022, there is a projected occupation growth of 20%.</p>
